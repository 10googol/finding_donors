    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "## Evaluating Model Performance\n",
    "In this section, we will investigate four different algorithms, and determine which is best at modeling the data. Three of these algorithms will be supervised learners of your choice, and the fourth algorithm is known as a *naive predictor*."
   ]

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "### Answers to Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Tree:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: IVR systems whenever you call customer service. For example when you call your bank you may be greeted \n",
    "   by a piece NLP software operating within the IVR that ask an initial question with some suggestions on how you \n",
    "   can answer. Your answer to that question is the root node and the NLP proceeds down the decision tree until it \n",
    "   reaches a leaf node with the answer to where to route your call.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: One big upside to a decision tree is it's easy to understand and explain. The hyperparameters are easier \n",
    "   to follow also and not overwhelming to someone new to progarmming machine learning algorithms. From the videos \n",
    "   for this course however it appears that it is easy for a decision tree to overfit data and one must be careful \n",
    "   in choosing the depth of the tree, as well as the minimum number samples per split and minimum number samples per \n",
    "   leaf. Along with these strengths decision trees can be used for both classification and regression. All that being \n",
    "   said decision trees work best when the data can be simply split in a binary fashion. \n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: As mentioned above one big drawback to a decision tree is that it can tend to overfit, making it sensitive \n",
    "   to variance in the data. Along with overfitting they may not handle skewed data well.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: I'm not sure that a decision tree is necessarily a good candidate for the problemm CharityML is looking to \n",
    "   solve. In fact based on the videos in this Nanodegree and various other readings decision trees aren't necessarily \n",
    "   good for problems where accuracy is required due to it's susceptibility to overfitting and senstivity to variance. \n",
    "   In short I'm choosing this algorithm as a beginner to compare to the more advanced ensemble method of decision trees \n",
    "   the random forest model. Based on all the videos and various books I've looked this up in, the ensemble method helps \n",
    "   correct some of the decision trees shortcomings. \n",

    "   Answer: I like a good glass of wine so I thought an intersting application of the random forest alogrithm was to \n",
    "   predict the quality of wine based on a dataset containg things like pH, sulphates, cholrides, and alcohol just too \n",

    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: Per the Nanodegree training ensemble methods help when there is a lot of data representing different \n",
    "   correlations or in the case of the first example video, when your not certain and there's a bunch of different \n",
    "   people with differing expertise you can vote on what everyone thinks and what ever gets the most votes that's the \n",
    "   final prediction. Like decision trees random forest have hyperparameters that are easy to understand and are can be \n",
    "   used for classification or regression problems. Unlike decision trees, random forest are weighted and build a consensus \n",
    "   which corrects the issues you may find with a decsion tree. Random forest probably perform well when there are a lot a \n",
    "   features and where the data may be skewed or overly dominate.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: The primary weakness of a random forest is it fast to train but can be slow to make predictions because of the large    number of trees and subsequent increase in accuracy, which means if runtime is consideration for the problem you're solving      random forest may not be your best choice.\n",

    "4. What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: As mentioned in the decision tree answer to this question random forest help correct the problems you may \n",
    "   encounter using decision trees. Given what we know about the CharityML data our outcomes should be as accurate as \n",
    "   possible and generalize well with a F Beta score that slants towards precision. We should see an increased accuracy \n",

    "\n",
    "   Answer: SVM models can work well when there is no clear way to separate the data. It also works well when there is a clear \n",
    "   separation between the data. With kernel functions this model can separate data in to hyperplanes making it effective in \n",
    "   higher dimensions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",

    "   Answer: In my readings the major disadvantage that stands out to me is the memory requirements and slow training times \n",

    "   difficult as well. With all this in mind SVM perform poorly with large datasets due to training time and problems that \n",
    "   aren't linearly separable. The diffculty in separability arises when having to choose a kernel to make a dataset separable. \n",

    "The Random Forest algorithm is essentially and extension of the decision tree. It takes our data and does many different iterations on the various columns, voting each time to determine which data occurs the most this is what data scientist or machine learning engineers call an ensemble method. \n",
    "\n",
    "But why do we need an ensemble method like a Random Forest algorithm? \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are great by themselves - right? We can find examples of them pretty easily in our daily lives and they're really easy to understand, like in the example of an IVR. Calling any company you may encounter an automated IVR system (you know, the one were you immediately start yelling operator or incessantly pushing the 0 button on your phone to get a real person) it starts off with a set of options and based on your answer to those options directs you down various other branches, asking questions at each junction of the branch until your call is finally routed to the correct department or person. It's called a Decision Tree because you can visualize the whole process as if it where a tree filled with branches and leaves. The first set of options/questions is the trunk or the tree, once you've answered the first question the decision tree sends you down one of the connected branches, each time asking a new set of questions to determine which branch to go down next eventually you reach the end of a branch and end up on a leaf where you finally get the answer you called for. \n",
    "\n",
    "A single Decision Tree is really great for specific situations like say your company only has two departments, the IVR questions just have to answer enough to send you down one of the two branches. Unfortunately, as we all know, most of the time real life is way more complicated. We are often innudated with questions that we may only have part of the answer too or no idea about it at all. We may specialize or even know a lot of different things, but in reality our individual knowledge is limited. We may not necessarily have all the answers or understand various connections/correlations in our surrounding world, so we start asking questions and searching until we have a suitable answer based on our extended research. Likewise in machine learning single Decision Trees are limited, in fact in industry jargon they are called weak learners. Enter the Random Forest algorithm. The Random Forest algorithm basically compensates for that weakness by running multiple Decision Trees on randomly selected data from a given data set then voting on the most prevalent end answer/prediction. By repeating that random process over and over the Random Forest is more capable of homing in on an answer/prediction that takes into account life's complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an ensemble method the Random Forest algorithm allows us to capture more accurately which individuals make $50K or more and are more likely to donate to your charity while taking into account complexity in the data set more efficiently than a single Decision Tree. Some side benefits of this algorithm are it's speed during training and testing in comparison to other models like a Support Vector Machine, as well as an ability to generalize better than other types of models."

    "The accuracy score and F-score for the optimized model are both somewhat better than unoptimized testing data.  There was also a huge improvement in the metrics for the random forest compared to the intial model evaluation which is due to we only used the first 300 training set data samples when we called the train_predict. On a side note, from what I've been reading in various articles on medium it appears that hyperparameter optimization is the last thing you want to work on provided you have exhausted all other ways to obtain data, usually more data improves the model more so than the optimization of hyperparameters. \n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "Interestingly enough the final model trained on the reduced data had slightly lower accuracy and F-score metrics. In general lower metrics scores on a reduced data set seems to be in line with what one would expect given the smaller amount of data. However, the final model's scores for the reduced data set are not that far off from the model trained on the full data set. With that in mind using the model trained on the reduced data will probably give comparable answers to that of the model trained on the full data set with possibly the added benefits of shorter training times and better generalization.
